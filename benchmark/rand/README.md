# Benchmark for random 2-XNF problems.
This directory contains random 2-XNF instances, where each lineral was sampled uniquely at random and independent of the other linerals.
Two variants are considered, completely random ones (which are with about 98% chance unsatisfiable), and ones, where a fixed solution was sampled and for each clause that does not satisfy it the constant of one of the linerals was randomly flipped.
The corresponding instances are given in XNF and CNF-XOR.
